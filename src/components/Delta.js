            Delta brainwaves are slow, loud brainwaves (low frequency and deeply penetrating, like a drum beat). Delta waves measure from .5 to 3 Hertz.
            They are generated in deepest meditation and dreamless sleep. Delta waves suspend external awareness and are the source of empathy. 
            Healing and regeneration are stimulated in this state, and that is why deep restorative sleep is so essential to the healing process
