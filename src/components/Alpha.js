              Alpha brainwaves linked to being in a relaxed state which could help low moods, creativity, and reduced anxiety because you're in a state of relaxation. 
              Alpha waves measure between 8 and 13 Hertz.
              There is another brainwave, which is called theta, that is a form dpper relaxation but alpha is a good starting point for feeling calm. 
              An alpha state is common the moment you wake up and right before you go to sleep but there are other potential ways of reaching alpha, which I will help provide.
